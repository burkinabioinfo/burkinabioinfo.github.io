## **Bioinformatics Training**

BBi organizes and collaborates with partner institutions to offer bioinformatics trainings tailored to the needs of researchers, students, and professionals. These sessions cover a wide range of topics, from the basics of bioinformatics to advanced genomic data analysis.

### **Examples of Past Trainings:**
1. **Introduction to Bioinformatics for Beginners**  
   - Training organized in partnership with [H3ABioNet IBT](https://www.h3abionet.org/training/ibt).  
   - A comprehensive introduction to bioinformatics tools and methods for genomic data analysis.

2. **RNA-Seq Data Analysis**  
   - Training offered by IRD: [Details of the RNA-Seq training](https://bioinfo.ird.fr/index.php/trainings-fr/trainings-2019-rnaseq/).  
   - A hands-on approach to exploring gene expression data.

3. **Introduction to Oxford Nanopore Sequencing Tools**  
   - Training based on content from the [GitHub project](https://github.com/Ezechiel-Tibiri/training_ONT_teaching).  
   - Techniques for preparation, sequencing, and analysis of ONT data.

4. **Bioinformatics Training - CIBIG Wave**  
   - An introduction to fundamental bioinformatics concepts available [here](https://cibig-wave.github.io/01-description.html).
